## SEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Step 1 — Tier 1: Wire Services & Aggregators
Run queries against wire services where companies formally announce rounds. These catch ~70% of deals.

**Sources**: Reuters, Bloomberg, PR Newswire, GlobeNewswire, Business Wire, EIN Presswire

**Queries** (adapt date window as needed):
- `[sector] startup funding [month] [year]`
- `[sector] Series A OR Series B OR seed OR IPO [month] [year]`
- `robotics funding round [month] [year]`
- `semiconductor chip startup raise [month] [year]`
- `space startup funding [month] [year]`
- `critical minerals materials startup funding [month] [year]`

### Step 2 — Tier 2: Tech & VC Press
Catch deals with editorial context and some exclusive scoops.

**Sources**: TechCrunch, Fortune, Business Insider, SiliconANGLE, Yahoo Finance, Crunchbase News, PitchBook News, Techstartups.com

**Queries**:
- `site:techcrunch.com [sector] funding [month] [year]`
- `site:news.crunchbase.com biggest funding rounds [month] [year]`
- `"[month] [year]" [sector] raises OR raised OR funding OR round`

### Step 3 — Tier 3: Sector-Specific Sources
Catch niche deals that generalist press misses.

**Semiconductors**: Semiconductor Engineering (quarterly startup funding reports are especially valuable), HPCwire, Data Centre Dynamics, EE Times, Photonics Spectra
**Robotics**: The Robot Report, RoboticsTomorrow, Humanoids Daily, Robotics & Automation News
**Space**: SpaceNews, Spaceflight Now, Satellite Today, Via Satellite
**Materials**: Mining.com, Battery-Tech Network, North American Mining Magazine

**Queries**:
- `site:semiengineering.com startup funding [quarter] [year]`
- `site:spacenews.com funding OR raises [month] [year]`
- `site:therobotreport.com funding OR raises [month] [year]`
- `site:mining.com startup funding critical minerals [month] [year]`

### Step 4 — Tier 4: Regional Sources
Fill geographic blind spots, especially Asia, Europe, LATAM, MENA.

**Europe**: EU-Startups.com, Sifted, Tech Funding News (TFN), DACH startup sources (e.g. startupradio.substack.com)
**Asia**: Tech in Asia, South China Morning Post (tech/business section), 36Kr
**LATAM**: LatamList
**MENA/Africa**: Wamda, Disrupt Africa

**Queries**:
- `European [sector] startup funding [month] [year]`
- `China [sector] startup funding OR IPO [month] [year]`
- `India semiconductor OR robotics funding [month] [year]`
- `Japan OR Korea [sector] funding [month] [year]`

### Step 5 — Tier 5: Crypto / Token-Specific
For DePIN, decentralised compute, and other token-related fundraises.

**Sources**: Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, The Block

**Queries**:
- `DePIN funding [month] [year]`
- `decentralised compute token funding [month] [year]`
- `robotics crypto token raise [month] [year]`

### Step 6 — Tier 6: Databases, Investor Blogs & Ecosystem
Catch early-stage deals and those without press coverage.

**Sources**: Tracxn, Dealroom, Crunchbase (company profiles), Y Combinator companies page, university tech transfer announcements, startup blog posts

**Queries**:
- `site:ycombinator.com/companies [sector] [year]`
- `[university name] spinout funding [sector] [month] [year]`
- `[known investor name] investment [sector] [month] [year]`

### Step 7 — Tier 7: Investor Blog Sweep
VCs announce investments on their own blogs, often with more detail than press releases.

**Key frontier tech investors to check**:

Robotics-focused: Lux Capital, Eclipse Ventures, Playground Global, Coatue, DCVC, Khosla Ventures, Sequoia, Tiger Global
Semiconductor-focused: Intel Capital, Samsung Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, Applied Ventures, TSMC-affiliated funds
Space-focused: Space Capital, Seraphim Capital, In-Q-Tel, Lockheed Martin Ventures, Boeing HorizonX
Materials-focused: The Engine (MIT), Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC
Generalist with frontier exposure: a16z, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Accel, Bessemer

**Queries**:
- `site:[investor-domain] investment OR portfolio [sector] [month] [year]`
- `[investor name] blog new investment [month] [year]`
- Check investor portfolio pages for newly added companies

---

## DOUBLE-VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

After the initial sweep produces a draft list, run a SECOND PASS on every entry that is missing ANY of these critical fields:
- Lead Investor(s)
- Amount ($M)
- Location

### Second Pass Procedure:

1. **Search with enriched queries**:
   - `"[Company name]" "[Round stage]" [year] "led by" OR investors OR valuation`
   - `"[Company name]" funding [amount if known] [month] [year]`
   - `"[Company name]" raises OR secures OR closes [year]`

2. **Check these specific sources in order** (higher = more likely to have full detail):
   a. Company's own website / newsroom / blog
   b. Lead investor's blog or portfolio page
   c. LinkedIn posts from the company's CEO/founders
   d. Sector-specific trade press (SpaceNews, The Robot Report, SemiEngineering, Mining.com)
   e. Crunchbase company profile
   f. TechCrunch, Fortune, Bloomberg articles

3. **For each missing field, record**:
   - The enriched value found
   - The source URL where it was found (this may differ from the primary source)
   - If still not found after second pass, mark as "n/d" (not disclosed)

4. **Source URL quality rule**:
   - If the primary source URL is dead (404), a company blog that has been reorganised, or behind a paywall with no useful preview, REPLACE it with the best alternative source found during the second pass
   - Priority order for source URLs:
     1. Original company announcement or press release
     2. Lead investor's blog post about the investment
     3. Sector-specific trade press article
     4. Generalist tech press (TechCrunch, etc.)
     5. Wire service (Reuters, Bloomberg)
   - The source URL must be LIVE and accessible at time of sweep

5. **Validation checkpoint**: After second pass, count entries still missing Lead Investor(s). If >20% of entries are missing this field, the sweep is incomplete — run additional targeted searches.

## ROBOTNIK'S NOTES (Column K)

Original intelligence commentary — NOT a restatement of the press release.

### Each note should answer:

1. **What does this company do?** (one sentence, specific)
2. **Who else in the frontier stack is relevant?** Cross-reference against the Robotnik public market universe (347 entities) and other companies in the funding database. Note relationships: competitors, customers, suppliers, ecosystem partners.
3. **What does the round size signal?** Compare to sector and stage norms, prior rounds by the same company, and geographic context.
4. **What should the reader watch for next?** (follow-on round, product launch, partnership, IPO path, regulatory milestone)
5. **Any notable investor context?** (lead investor's track record, strategic investors signalling thesis, co-investment patterns)

### Example of good Robotnik's Notes:

"European heavy kickstage for orbital transfer, enabling last-mile satellite deployment. Operates in the same in-orbit transport segment as Momentus (MNTS) and D-Orbit. €40M seed is 3x the median European space seed in trailing 12M, signalling strong conviction. Backed by [Investor] who also led [related company]'s Series A. Watch for ESA in-orbit servicing contracts and potential Rocket Lab (RKLB) or Firefly (FLY) launch partnerships."

### Example of BAD notes:

"Raised €40M seed round for kickstage development. Plans to scale operations."

---

## CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

When writing Robotnik's Notes, actively cross-reference each entry against:

1. **Robotnik Public Market Universe**: If related public companies exist in the 347-entity universe, name them with their ticker.

2. **Other Funding Rounds in Database**: Reference prior rounds or related companies that have also raised.

3. **Sector Patterns**: Note if multiple companies in the same subsector raised in the same period.

4. **Investor Patterns**: Note if the lead investor has backed other companies in the database.

### REMOVED COLUMNS (from v2):
- **Verification Status**: Removed. Missing valuation is normal market behaviour, not a data quality failure. If the company, sector, round, amount (or "n/d"), lead investor (or "n/d"), and date are present, the entry is considered complete.

### Formatting Rules
- No section divider rows
- Freeze header row
- Auto-filter enabled on all columns
- Arial font, size 10
- Header row: white text on dark blue (#2F5496)
- Data rows: thin light grey borders, wrap text, top-aligned
